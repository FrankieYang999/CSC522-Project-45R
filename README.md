# CSC522-Project-45R


Q1) (10 points) KNN + Cross Validation
In the previous HW, you implemented the KNN algorithm. For this project, you will learn how to
use 10-Fold Cross Validation to estimate the optimal value of k in a KNN classification task.
You will be using the ‘iris’ dataset.
Start with your_unity_id_knn_cv.R and fill in the missing content. The “###”s roughly indicate that
the line(s) below need(s) modification from you, or that you are expected to write your own section
of code based on the comments specified above the ‘###’s. It should be straightforward as to what
is asked and what the various variables are supposed to contain, especially since the file is heavily
commented. You might want to refresh your memory on cross validation from the textbook -
page 187.
Submission instructions:
● Ensure that you do not rename the variables in the template.
● Ensure that you do not clear the workspace at the start.
● Submit using the naming convention specified above.


Q2) (10 points) Adaboost Classifier
For this project, you will learn how to implement an Adaboost Classifier .
You will be using the ‘Ionosphere’ dataset for this part of the project.
Start with your_unity_id_adb.R and fill in the missing content. The “###”s roughly indicate that the
functions below need to be completed by you, or that you are expected to write your own section of
code based on the comments specified above the ‘###’s. It should be straightforward as to what is
asked and what the various variables are supposed to contain, especially since the file is heavily
commented. You might want to refresh your memory on adaboost classifier from the
textbook - Algorithm 5.7 under section 5.6.5.
Submission instructions:
● Ensure that you do not rename the variables in the template.
● Ensure that you do not clear the workspace at the start.
● Submit using the naming convention specified above.
